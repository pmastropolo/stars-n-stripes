### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (or **yarn** if preferred)

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, use the following command: npm run dev

- This will start a local server at http://localhost:3000 where you can view the app in real-time as you make changes.

### Building the Project

To build the project for production, run: npm run build

- This will create an optimized build in the dist/ folder.

### Previewing the Build

To preview the production build locally, run: npm run preview
This starts a server to preview the optimized production build.

### Linting

To run ESLint and check for code quality issues, use the following: npm run lint

### Available Scripts

In this project, the following scripts are available:

- npm run dev: Starts the development server using Vite.
- npm run build: Builds the project for production.
- npm run lint: Runs ESLint on the project files.
- npm run preview: Previews the built project.
- npm run start: Starts the preview server (same as npm run preview).
